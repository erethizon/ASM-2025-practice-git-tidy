# ASM-2025-practice-git-tidy
## Overview
This repository provides some practice material to support the Reproducible Research in R workshop 
presented by [Marissa Dyck](https://github.com/marissadyck) and [Erika Barthelmess](https://github.com/erethizon) at the
2025 annual meeting of the American Society of Mammalogists.
